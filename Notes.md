# Experiment 1

## Greedy Algorithm
- Start at the first city (or any chosen city).
- At each step, find the nearest unvisited city and travel to it.
- For each unvisited city, calculate the distance to the current city.
- Select the city with the minimum distance as the next city.
- Repeat the process** until all cities are visited.
- Return to the starting city to complete the loop.

> **Time Complexity**:  
> The greedy algorithm checks every unvisited city for the closest one, making it an **O(n²)** algorithm, where `n` is the number of cities.

> **Space Complexity**:  
> The space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of cities, due to storing the list of visited cities and distances.

---

## Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm
- Divide: Split the list of cities into two halves based on their x-coordinates.
  - Sort the cities by x-coordinates to prepare for splitting.
  - Recursively divide the cities until each subset contains two or three cities.
- Conquer: Solve the problem for each half recursively.
  - For small subsets (with 2 or 3 cities), compute the shortest pair by brute-force.
  - Track the minimum distance found in both halves.
- Combine: After solving both halves, check for any shorter path between cities across the division line.
  - Specifically, check for the closest pair where one city is in the left half and the other is in the right half.

> **Time Complexity**:  
> The divide-and-conquer approach operates in **O(n log n)** time because it sorts the cities and divides them recursively.

> **Space Complexity**:  
> The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the recursive division and the space required to store city coordinates and distances.

## Dynamic Programming (TSP) Algorithm
- Use Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking to find the globally optimal solution for visiting all cities and returning to the starting point.
- Initialize a DP table dp[mask][i] where:
  - mask represents the set of visited cities as a bitmask.
  - i is the current city being visited.
  - dp[mask][i] stores the minimum distance to visit all cities in the set mask ending at city i.
- Set the base case: Starting from city 0, dp[1][0] = 0 (starting at city 0 with only city 0 visited).
- For each subset of cities, calculate the minimum distance for visiting each city and update the DP table by considering all possible next steps:
  - Transition from city u to city v if city v has not yet been visited in the current subset.
  - Update dp[mask | (1 << v)][v] to keep track of the shortest path to visit v.
- Once all cities are visited, check the minimum cost to return to the starting city.
- Reconstruct the path by backtracking from the last visited city to the starting city.

> **Time Complexity**:  
> The dynamic programming algorithm for the TSP has a time complexity of **O(n² * 2ⁿ)** due to the bitmasking approach for subsets and the recursive path reconstruction.

> **Space Complexity**:  
> The space complexity is **O(n * 2ⁿ)** because we need to store the DP table that tracks all possible subsets of cities and their respective shortest paths.

## Comparison of Algorithms

- **Greedy Algorithm**: 
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(n²)**
  - **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**
  - Fast and easy to implement but may not produce the optimal solution.

- **Divide-and-Conquer**:
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(n log n)**
  - **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**
  - Effective for the closest-pair problem but is not typically used for solving the full TSP. It is more specialized for dividing the problem space and solving subproblems efficiently.

- **Dynamic Programming (TSP)**: 
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(n² * 2ⁿ)**
  - **Space Complexity**: **O(n * 2ⁿ)**
  - Guarantees the optimal solution but is computationally expensive for large datasets. This algorithm is the gold standard for solving the TSP exactly.
