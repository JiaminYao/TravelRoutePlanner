## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Homebrew** installed on your system. If it’s not installed, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

> **Note:** You will also need to install **OpenCV** and **pkg-config** using **Homebrew** to compile and run the C++ program. Follow the steps below.

```bash
# Install Homebrew (if not installed already)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install pkg-config and OpenCV using Homebrew
brew install pkg-config
brew install opencv

# Verify OpenCV installation
pkg-config --modversion opencv4

# Compile the C++ program using g++ and OpenCV libraries
g++ -o travel travel.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`

# Run the compiled program
./travel
