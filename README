# 🗺️ Travel Route Planner  
**Optimizing Multi-City Travel Routes Across Europe**

## 📌 Project Overview

Planning efficient travel routes across multiple European cities is a complex optimization problem involving trade-offs between **distance, cost, and time**. This project develops a **Travel Route Planner** that computes optimized routes under different transportation scenarios using classic algorithmic approaches to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.

Three travel modes are analyzed:
- 🚁 **Helicopter** — shortest distance
- 🚗 **Driving** — minimum cost and minimum time (regular roads vs highways)
- ✈️ **Flights** — minimum cost and minimum time

The system compares **Greedy**, **Divide and Conquer**, and **Dynamic Programming** algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness under different optimization objectives :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.


## 📊 Dataset Description

A custom dataset of **18 major European cities** was constructed using user-selected coordinates on a map of Europe.

### Dataset Components
1. **City Coordinates**
   - Generated by clicking locations on a Europe map
   - Used to compute Euclidean distances and visualize routes
   - Distance scaling ratio: **1 unit ≈ 0.9 km**

2. **Driving (Regular Roads)**
   - Cost based on fuel consumption only
   - Time based on country-specific speed limits

3. **Driving (Highways)**
   - Cost includes fuel + toll fees
   - Faster travel times due to higher speed limits

4. **Flights**
   - Synthetic but realistic flight costs
   - Synthetic flight durations based on real flight patterns

All datasets include **cost (USD)** and **time (minutes)** between city pairs :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.


## 🧠 Methodology

This project applies three algorithms to solve TSP-style optimization problems under different constraints.

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Greedy Algorithm**
  - Chooses the locally optimal next city
  - Time complexity: **O(n²)**
  - Fast but not globally optimal

- **Divide and Conquer Algorithm**
  - Recursively splits cities into subsets
  - Time complexity: **O(n log n)**
  - Performs poorly for global route optimization

- **Dynamic Programming Algorithm**
  - Uses bitmasking to evaluate all city subsets
  - Time complexity: **O(n² · 2ⁿ)**
  - Guarantees global optimality


## 🧪 Experiments

### Experiment 1: Helicopter (Shortest Distance)
- Uses Euclidean distance between city coordinates
- Objective: minimize total travel distance
- Result: **Dynamic Programming consistently finds the shortest routes**

### Experiment 2: Driving (Cost & Time)
- Regular roads vs highways
- Objectives:
  - Minimum driving cost
  - Minimum driving time
- Result:
  - **Dynamic Programming best for large city sets**
  - **Greedy competitive for small city sets**

### Experiment 3: Flights (Cost & Time)
- Synthetic flight cost and duration matrices
- Result:
  - **Dynamic Programming achieves lowest cost**
  - Greedy is faster but suboptimal
  - Divide and Conquer performs worst overall


## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Each experiment is evaluated using:
- **Total Distance (km)**
- **Total Cost (USD)**
- **Total Time (minutes)**
- **Time Complexity**
- **Space Complexity**

Results are analyzed by varying the number of cities from **6 to 18**, allowing performance comparison at different scales.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Custom graph and optimization implementations


## 🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates that **Dynamic Programming** consistently produces the most optimal travel routes across all scenarios, achieving the shortest distances, lowest costs, and minimal travel times. However, its exponential time and space complexity limit scalability.

Key insights:
- **Dynamic Programming** → best accuracy, high cost
- **Greedy Algorithm** → fast and practical for small datasets
- **Divide and Conquer** → inefficient for global route optimization

The study highlights the importance of selecting algorithms based on **dataset size and optimization priorities**. Future work may extend this system to support **multi-modal travel**, **real-time data**, and **interactive route visualization** :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
